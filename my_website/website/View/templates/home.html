                Hello, my name is Jordan Williams. Welcome to my website which showcases my portfolio of personal projects. I built this site using Flask.
                I am a computer science student at Weber State University, aspiring to be a software engineer. My hobbies include playing video games
                such as League of Legends and Overwatch, as well as reading. My strengths are that I'm a fast learner, I work well with people and I communicate effectively.
                I am great at both following instruction, as well as solving problems on my own. Be sure to check out my resume and projects.
                I hope I can be an impressive applicant and that we can work together soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.
            </p>
